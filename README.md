# n-threshold-Gerber-correlation

Extension of Gerber correlation statistic [(Gerber et al. ,2022)](https://www.pm-research.com/content/iijpormgmt/48/3/87) by allowing an arbitrary number of *n* thresholds as well as incorporating the Exponentially Weighted Moving Average method.


## What's included:

### code/
Contains the code for running backtests.
* ds_ssvi: SSVI algorithm for DS-NMF
* s_ssvi: original SSVI algorithm for NMF by Liang et al. (2014), modified a little bit
* ds_ssvi_gibbs: Gibbs sampling version of the SSVI algorithm for DS-NMF

### notes/
Contains the report (with derivations in the Appendix) and short presentation slides about DS-NMF with SSVI.
